          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p class="intro">I designed the football app OneTwo end to end, from research to clickable high-fidelity prototype. OneTwo is a mobile app that allows football players to see their stats, videos, save and share. Note: This is a project delivered as part of my UX/UI apprenticeship at Bloc.</p>

            <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
            <h2>A suboptimal Football experience.</h2>
            <p>Football players (no matter whether they are amateur or professional) find a very hard time accessing the stats and videos of the games they play, and storing valuable content they see online.</p>
            <p>As a result, their football experience is not complete, either because their individual performance on the pitch is lower than it could be, or because they struggle at saving and sharing exciting football content with peers.</p>

          <h2>Hello OneTwo.</h2>
          <p>OneTwo is a mobile app that allows football players to take full control of their football experience.</p>
          <p>Whether players are looking to improve their performance by receiving meaningful stats and videos of the games they played, or whether they are amateur football players looking to save and share exciting football content, OneTwo will be there for them.</p>

          <h1>Research and Discovery</h1>
          <p class="intro">How could you build an app out of only one sentence from a client? I decided to invest time to research and have a better understanding about what I should be working on.</p>

          <h3>SCOPING THE PROJECT</h3>
          <h2>First things first.</h2>
          <p>"We're really excited at the possibilities we see in the cloud storage and organization market (...) there's room for another player if we can find the right combination of features to meet the needs of a particular audience".</p>
          <p>That was all. Naturally, the first thing I needed to do is to clearly define what the problem we wanted to solve for was and what the available resources were. A list of potential problems to be solved was compiled in order to have a basic structure to start off, and also a list of questions to be answered along the way.</p>
          <p>Given that the client was open to target specific niches and given that I know the football market quite well, a decision was made to shift the research towards understanding whether the football market (coaches and players) would be in need of a storage solution.</p>

          <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
          <h2>Storing, stats and sharing?</h2>
          <p>Next, I carried out a competitive analysis focusing on Google Drive, Dropbox and Evernote (which are primarily storage apps), but also looking at Wyscout and Instat Scout, which are football platforms that provide stats and videos to Coaches.</p>
          <p>I also looked at how these apps where structured along three tasks: uploading files, organizing file and sharing files.</p>

              <p>With these valuable insights, I was able to create four User Personas. Clearly there were different types of users, with clearly different needs (yet some overlapping).

Some would value storing and organizing, some others would find valuable to get football performance data right away on their devices.</p>

              <p>So before moving onto the Visual Design stage, I ran a Usability Test, testing three of the high-priority tasks: signing up, uploading a file and organizing a file.</p>

              <h2>A big challenge: What is, technically, a Game?</p>
              <p>From an information architecture point of view, the biggest challenge was to define what a Game is. Unlike traditional storage app, where one could have essentially folders, files and tags, the concept of Game also arises.</p>
              <p>The definition adopted for “Game” was the following:</p>
              <p>- A Game is an element different from a folder, a file or a tag.</p>
              <p>- A Game acts as a folder in the sense that it can store other files (or folders) and that it can be associated with tags. But also a Game can contain stats and performance information coming from a data provider.</p>
              <p>- A Game can also have “Season” and “Matchday” as attributes.</p>

            <h3>BRANDING AND BRANDING DISCOVERY</h3>
            <h2>Bringing the joy of color.</h2>
            <p>The branding phase was a big process in itself, involving but not limited to the following:</p>
            <p>- Branding research</p>
            <p>- Refinement and Moodboards</p>
            <p>- Color Palettes and Style Guide</p>
            <p>How could I convey, through an appropriate use of fontypes, colors, images and communication, a significant set of emotions desired by a broad audience, ranging from purely football fans looking to have fun or store feelings, to professional players, who might take it more seriously and who would be simply looking to perform better? Definitely not easy :)</p>

                <h4>Mind Mapping</h4>
                <p>The following mind-mapping was carried out in order to start tying ideas together. Three concepts were taken into account to start. The app should have: (a) <span style="font-weight: bold;">The integration of Hudl</span> in order to be able to get each player´s videos and help them perform better; (b) <span style="font-weight: bold;">The capacity to store </span>that Google Drive has; (c) <span style="font-weight: bold;">The ability to share </span>in a seamless way in order to maximize any football-fan experience.</p>

                <h4>Naming the app: Dito or OneTwo?</h4>
                <p>Also, two strong candidates for the name of the product were discovered: “Dito” (meaning “control” in Latin) and “One-Two”. OneTwo was chosen. “One-two” is a football concept. It is the action when one player has at least one opponent in front of him, and in order to “eliminate” this/these opponent(s), he passes the ball to another player and runs forward to receive the pass from his teammate (but now far from his opponent). “One-two” represents quite precisely the spirit of the app and finally chosen as the name of the solution. OneTwo is made for individuals, but it gets more powerful when shared with the team.</p>

                <h4>Moodboard</h4>
                <p>With the concepts I wanted to create the solution around and with the feelings I wanted to convey, now was time to start putting together the colors and the elements that could appropriately represent what I wanted to create. Thus, I created a moodboard in InVision.</p>

              <h4>Creating the Style Guide</h4>
              <p>After all this thorough process, I was able to put together a Style Guide, which would help me turn my wireframes into live, high-fidelity mockups. Also, I could maintain a high level of consistency across screens, something quite difficult to achieve, given that the app had two very different sections (storage and performance.). <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ptczN-bWt5e_pdlGTcfKhbnkERz75bGB" target="_blank">Here is a link to the full style guide.</a></p>

            <p>Throughout the process I made different iterations, some of them being tested afterwards through preference tests. </p>

            <p>After that, tests were carried out testing three more high-priority tasks. The three tasks were ran successfully in a timely manner by the three users, sometimes following different paths.

There was an opportunity to optimize the process by merging both options into one (e.g. “Share”) and/or by improving the wording (e.g. instead of saying “share with teammates” to say “share internally”, “share via OneTwo”, etc).</p>

        <h1>Lessons and further work</h1>
        <p>In these 3 months of work, I had the opportunity to embark on one of the biggest digital challenges I had so far. OneTwo ended up becoming an app that solves clearly defined problems (performance stats and storage for football players), but it hasn´t been easy to get there. In particular, some of the key lessons and further work are the following:</p>

          <li class="lessons_tip"><span style="font-weight:bold">Setting up the Information Architecture,</span> especially around the concept of Game. In the end, and broadly speaking, a Game is like a Folder that has all the attributions of a Folder but that can also have distinguishing characteristics: It can store additional information (such as performance stats) and the view is different. Coming up with this definition and setting up the relationship between this element (Game) and the other elements (Folders, Files, Tags) hasn´t been easy.</li>
          <li class="lessons_number">2</li>
          <li class="lessons_tip"><span style="font-weight:bold">How to achieve consistency between the Storage and the Performance sections. </span>I´ve come to a stage where the app has achieved a sense of necessary consistency. But a lot of work has been put into trying to achieve it. Even so, a question remaining is how important achieving consistency in these two sections is (given that it might be going to be used by different types of users, and who uses one section may probably won´t use the other one). Especially when it comes to the use of colors, including neutrals. Had I had more time, I would have explored and tested this more.</li>
