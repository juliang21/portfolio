        <p class="intro">During season 2015/16 I had the opportunity to wear a different hat and take a Ms in Talent Development in Football at Real Madrid School. Not only I created AFA 360, my 300-page player development model for the Argentine football, but also I was chosen to work at Real Madrid that season. This is what I learnt from this experience.</p>

          <h3>MS IN TALENT DEVELOPMENT IN FOOTBALL</h3>
          <h2>Learning to develop world-class football players.</h2>
          <p>One of our key metrics <a href="animaedu.com">in AnimaEdu</a> is how we can increase our cross-sell rate for existing students. We know many of them are genuinely interested in buying more courses, which is something great for everyone: As long as our courses help them discover their inner growth, it is a win-win for everyone.</p>
          <p>Even though we had some ideas to implement longer term (such as developing an all-you-can-eat feature), the big question is: How can we increase the cross-sell rate rate in students in a 2-week sprint?</p>

          <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
          <h2>Let´s start risk "free".</h2>
          <p>I assessed and designed a cross-sell feature to allow students to buy a second course with a 50% discount. After each course purchase, the students receives the opportunity to buy another course by clicking on the CTA.</p>
          <p>This offer currently shows only in the thank you page after assessing risks and feasibility, but with a big opportunity for more complex and risky (yet potentially rewarding) improvements.</p>

            <h3>MY MASTERS</h3>
            <h2>Learning to develop world-class football players.</h2>
            <p>In November 2015 I started my Ms in Talent Identification and Development in Football, at Real Madrid School, in Madrid.</p>
            <p>During one full academic year, we studied, visited and welcomed more than 15 of the top-class Youth Academies in Europe, including Real Madrid, Ajax, Feyenoord, AZ Alkmaar, Sevilla, Dinamo Zagreb, Athletic Bilbao, among others.</p>
            <p>It was a fantastic opportunity to get a solid understanding of the state of football development in different continents (I already know South America, this time was Europe), and to learn how different football entities design their methodologies and allocate their resources to meet their goals and get closer to their missions.</p>
            <p>I am a certified football coach, but I come from a totally different background than most others. This enabled me to see things from a different perspective and to detect right away what opportunities are out there in the football world to better connect goals with actions.</p>

              <p>During this time I had the opportunity to create AFA 360, my 300-page-long Thesis. It is a player development model for the Argentine Football Federation.</p>
              <p>AFA 360 is the result of four main experiences: 1) My Ms in Talent Development; 2) The experience working at Real Madrid; 3) My almost 6 years at Google; 4) The knowledge on football methodology gained by getting certified as a Smart Football Coach in Catalunya (certified by the Catalan Football Federation).</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, due to copyright restrictions imposed by Smart Football, I cannot make AFA 360 publicly available. However, feel free to write to me and we can talk privately.</p>

              <p>After carefully weighting potential and risks, we decided to go for the upsell on the thank you page (option 4). Not only was that a low risk feature, but it also didn´t interfere with the current user flow. Everything would be incremental, and that would act as a baseline revenue benchmark for future decisions.</p>

          <h2>The elite of the elite.</h2>
          <p>During that year, 4 students were chosen to work at Real Madrid Youth Academy. Luckily I was one of those. I had the chance to be a Tactical Analyst for U13-U17 teams, and also to be involved in the administration of the Academy.</p>

        <p>It was a fantastic experience for many reasons, including the possibility to get a closer look at how one of the top clubs in the world organizes their resources and develops elite players.</p>
        <p>I also developed the ability to see problems from the Coach and Players´ points of view, and to leverage on this information to get specific football insights and to deliver recommendations with the goal of increasing performance. This is something that I was already doing <a href="https://rondos.futbol">on my website Rondos</a> (followed by 60k people including Twitter and Facebook), where I deliver tactical analyses since 2015.</p>
        <p>When the season was over I was invited to continue working at the Academy, but due to family and personal reasons, we decided to go back to Argentina.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Apart from the fantastic year itself, it has been an outstanding opportunity to continue developing different muscles. And they are not isolated skills at all, but transferrable to almost any discipline. The following are some of them:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="lessons_insights">
        <ul>
          <li class="lessons_number">1</li>
          <li class="lessons_tip"><span style="font-weight:bold">The ability to wear different hats.</span> When asked what I am, it gets very hard to answer in one sentence. And I feel very proud for that. My technical/data-driven background, as well as my experience working in different positions and constantly cross-functionally, allows me to be able communicate effectively with different stakeholders at any organisation, a key asset when it comes to achieving goals. We tend to split the world into disciplines because everything gets more manageable. But I feel very happy to be able to jump into different disciplines and thrive.</li>
          <li class="lessons_number">2</li>
          <li class="lessons_tip"><span style="font-weight:bold">The experience in fostering innovative cultures.</span> After almost 6 years of working at Google (two of them at its Headquarters, in Silicon Valley), apart from working in a data-driven culture, among other things, I learnt how to build, nurture and foster environments with innovation as a central component to excel. Bringing that to other entities is something that I find really valuable for everyone.</li>
