        <h1>Hi, I´m Julian Genoud.</h1>
        <p>I´m from the beautiful Argentina, but “made” in Silicon Valley, Madrid and Catalunya. As a typical Argentine, I have these mixed roots (Swiss, Croatian, Spanish and Italian), which in a way have granted me a curious, very open, and growth mindset.</p>
        <p class="desktop">I have a strong background in business, product… and football. Yes, you read well. Among other experiences, I worked 6 years at Google but I was also a Tactical Analyst at Real Madrid, chosen the best club in the world in 20th Century.</p>

        <h2>Product, Business... and Football.</h2>
        <p>What do football, business and product have in common? They are similar in the sense that <span style="font-weight:bold;">one is always designing an experience</span>, and that the success of that experience depends on very (very very) similar principles and processes. If you want to read more about how I had combined these three disciplines, you might want to read about “AFA 360”, a 300-page-long Player Development Model I developed for the Argentine Football Federation.</p>

        <h2>An Experience Designer.</h2>
        <p>After a lot of iteration, the closest term I have found to define what I am is a <span style="font-weight:bold; font-family: 'Raleway'; color:#555;">multidisciplinary Experience Designer</span>. And the term “experience” has been carefully chosen, because sometimes I solve purely product challenges, sometimes those problems are rather more related to business strategy, or to people and the way they interact with each other... or even all at the same time!</p>
        <p class="last"><span style="font-weight:bold; font-family: 'Raleway'; color:#555;">Connecting the experiences I build with data and KPIs is part of my DNA, but I never (ever!) forget about the human side of things</span>. The best proof for that is my experience as a Football Coach. Football is a very interesting sport in the sense that even though a lot of things could be measured and explained by data, you can´t skip the qualitative aspects of it. You just can´t skip it. Conversations with your players and conversations with the rest of the Coaching Staff on an everyday basis are key to making better training and game decisions. The way you listen to and give feedback are key to success. I was able to develop that “muscle” and I constantly apply it to my everyday life, complementing my analytical brain just perfectly.</p>

        <h2>A proud Googler. A team player.</h2>
        <p>My 6 years at Google (two of them at their headquarters in Silicon Valley) have allowed me to generate and manage millions in revenue (and not get scared about it!), innovate at scale, lead projects at a global level and learn about an outstanding way of growing business and creating culture. The past 3.5 years outside of Google have also seen me grow and evolve from a strong business individual contributor to a people and product manager. I´m currently the Product Manager of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.mindfulness924927&hl=en" target="_blank">the meditation app Pausa</a> and managing a team of 5 great outstanding Engineers.</p>
