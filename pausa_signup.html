        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p class="intro">This is how I redesigned the sign-up process for meditation app Pausa, with the goal of increasing sign-ups rate. This was part of a larger project, where I also created an onboarding process after sign-up.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="problem_info">
          <img src="img/problem_icon1.png" style="width: 100px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
          <h2>45% of our users don´t even start using Pausa.</h2>
          <p>On average, only 67% of the users downloading Pausa end up signing up. Furthermore, only 55% of the users start listening to our 7-day meditation program, which we consider key to make them feel happy with Pausa and end up subscribing.</p>
          <p>How could we drive more sign-ups and engagement so that they at least try out the meditation app?</p>

          <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
          <h2>A greater sign-up process for users.</h2>
          <p>I led the design process of building two separate but very linked features:</p>
          <p>- A redesign of our sign-up process.</p>
          <p>- A new onboarding process after the sign-up.</p>
          <p>We believe that, altogether, this would allow users to have a better understanding about what they can expect to get and achieve by using Pausa.</p>
          <p>What follows is how we created the sign-up process. If you want to see how we created the onboarding process, <a href="pausa_onboarding.html">click here.</a></p>

          <h1>Failing Fast</h1>
          <p class="intro">Our initial hypothesis was that it was just a “journey problem”. By cutting down the number of screens and improving the visuals, we could increase the percentage of users signing up. However, this didn´t work. Let´s see why.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fail_user_story">
            <h3>USER STORIES AND FLOWS</h3>
            <h2>A low hanging fruit... or maybe not?</h2>
            <p>Based on my initial hypothesis, user stories were written down to make sure that all the tasks could be accomplished seamlessly.</p>
            <p>After that, user flows were created for all the high-priority tasks. The original flow was the one you can see below. Just by reducing one screen, we thought we could make a big difference.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fail_block">
            <p class="blockquote">“By reducing the number of screens to sign up and making visual adjustments, we´ll reduce the sign-up drop-off.” This was my initial hypothesis.</p>

        <div class="fail_conclusion">
            <p class="blockquote">Below you can see where we thought the low hanging fruit was. If we could merge these two screens, then that would be enough (and we could continue with other projects). It was an agile approach aiming to solve a problem at a very low cost.</p>

              <h3>HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h3>
              <h2>Design, test, go!</h2>
              <p>With this hypothesis in mind, I took the opportunity not only to reduce the number of screens, but also I created a slight change in our style.</p>
              <p>I iterated with a few variantions, and to validate my suggestion to change colors, I ran a preference test.</p>

          <div class="fail_conclusion_2">
            <p class="blockquote">But.... unfortunately this didn´t work. At least, we weren´t able to increase the sign-up rate. Then, what could be going on?</p>

            <h2>Recalibrating: What if users want to know more before signing up?</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, this change didn´t work. Just reducing the number of screens didn´t increase the sign-up rate. And that made a lot of sense: Users would come to Pausa through paid ads, land to Google Play or the Apple store and then install the app. Or they would even just install the app right away. <span style="font-weight: bold;">How likely would it be for someone to just sign up without even knowing what the dynamics of the app would be?</span></p>
            <p>So we decided we had to understand better what our users valued, what our competition was doing and what changes we could make. Again, this was part of a broader sprint, but we were allowed to leverage on these initiatives to get very valuable information for this particular case.</p>

            <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <h2>Tell me a story.</h2>
            <p>To start with, a member of the team carried out a competitive analysis focusing specifically on how other similar apps (Headspace, Calm, Mind Valley, Simple Habit, etc.) were onboarding their users, both pre and post sign-up. A larger competitive analysis was also conducted as part of our overall strategy redesign (<a href="">see here</a>).</p>

        </div>
        <p>With not so much text, a lot of interactive animation showing different moments of everyday life, a very strong website and specially using key concepts (mind, love), Headspace encourages their users to sign up. The story is very simple, yet very powerful.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="competitive-case2">
          <p>Calm even goes beyond. The hook here is to ask users what goals they want to achieve, right from the very beginning. As a user, there is no possibility I wouldn´t at least sign up. Fantastic idea.</p>

              <p>- Understand what well-being goals people are seeking for.</p>
              <p>- How they meditate (day/night, duration, etc).</p>

          <p>Thanks to the competitive analysis and survey conducted, we were able to add a new high-priority task: we realized that allowing users to understand more about what Pausa is about before signing up would help them take the decision to start. Thus, we decided to provide a series of messages right at the sign-up stage.</p>

          <p>One of our team members took the lead to define what key messages we would be showing to our users, with two main goals in mind: a) To provide them with an overall understanding on how to use Pausa; b) To guide them to what we considered was the best way to start the journey with Pausa: Our 7-day program for beginners.</p>
          <p>But even more important than that, we set up our app to be able to AB test between messages, so as to iterate and find the right hook.</p>

            <p>We discussed internally and decided that at this stage we wouldn´t make any major change regarding colors. However, as we were aware of the fact that we would be placing much more text than in other screens, we explored the opportunity to use a white/light background instead of our classic light blue one.</p>
            <p>With this in mind, I sketched different versions, experimenting with our primary and secondary colors. The main concept regarding the feeling we wanted to convey was calmness and pureness.</p>

          <p>Although there has been a slight improvement in sign-ups already, the key achievement is that we were able to set up the machinery to AB test between messages.</p>
          <p>Plus, there´s still a lot more we can work on this front! (see conclusions)</p>

        <h1>Lessons and further work</h1>
        <p>In these 3 weeks of intense work, we as a team had the opportunity to optimize key areas in Pausa. Not only did we start improving our sign-up flow, but also we set up the machinery to AB test and iteratively find the most appealing messaging for our users. There are a few lessons and also a lot more we can and are planning to do:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="lessons_insights">
        <ul>
          <li class="lessons_number">1</li>
          <li class="lessons_tip"><span style="font-weight:bold">There are no shortcuts. </span>Sometimes, making too many assumptions for the sake of accelerating launches may cost more than taking the time to go back to the user. To be constantly aware of the relation between feasibility/costs and impact is very important. In this particular case, I had originally overestimated the impact that we would generate by making a few tweaks without the need to go ask our users. It could have worked but it didn´t. Stepping back proved to work well in this case.</li>
          <li class="lessons_number">2</li>
          <li class="lessons_tip"><span style="font-weight:bold">Should we keep our CTAs (sign-up and login) always present or should we make sure user reads our message? </span>We had a very long debate around this topic. From a theoretically and purely user story point of view, it might make sense to avoid running the risk of some users ending up not signing up because of them not wanting to slide in. From a strategic point of view, the flow goes fast and we might want to make sure that they understand our value proposition from the very beginning. We are implementing a more granular event tracking to understand this better, and I already designed variations with an always-present CTA to test.</li>
          <li class="lessons_number">3</li>
          <li class="lessons_tip"><span style="font-weight:bold">Remove the “Name” field in the sign-up process, to later on.</span> We are aware that the “Name” field might be noisy at this stage, causing some users to drop off as they need to enter three different types of information before being able to start using the app. We consider it an important field in order to give a higher sense of coziness inside Pausa, so we will develop a way to gather that info after the sign-up if we find that the drop-off is being caused by this.</li>
