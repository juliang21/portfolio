            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p class="intro">This is how I created an onboarding feature for users in meditation app Pausa, with the goal of increasing engagement and a better understanding of what they can get with Pausa. This was part of a larger project, where I also redesigned the sign-up process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="problem_info">

          <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
          <h2>45% of our users don´t even start using Pausa.</h2>
          <p>On average, only 67% of the users downloading Pausa end up signing up. Furthermore, only 55% of the users start listening to our beginner´s 7-day meditation program, which we consider key to make them feel happy with Pausa and end up subscribing.</p>
          <p>Plus, only 25% of the users who listen to the first audio continue listening to the second audio.</p>
          <p>How could we drive more sign-ups and engagement so that they at least try out the meditation app?</p>

          <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
          <h2>A greater onboarding experience.</h2>
          <p>I led the design process of building two separate but very linked features:</p>
          <p>- A redesign of our sign-up process.</p>
          <p>- A new onboarding process after the sign-up.</p>
          <p>We believe that, altogether, this would allow users to have a better understanding about what they can expect to get and achieve by using Pausa.</p>
          <p>What follows is how we created the onboarding process. If you want to see how we redesigned the sign-up flow, <a href="pausa_signup.html">click here.</a></p>

          <h1>Research and Discovery</h1>
          <p class="intro">We decided to invest time to research and have a better understanding about what we should be working on. On one hand, we analyzed the competition. On the other, we surveyed our users.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="competitive_desc">
          <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
          <h2>Setting the right expectations and asking about goals.</h2>
          <p>To start with, a member of the team carried out a competitive analysis focusing specifically on how other similar apps (Headspace, Calm, Mind Valley, Simple Habit, etc.) were onboarding their users, both pre and post sign-up. A larger competitive analysis was also conducted as part of our overall strategy redesign (<a href="">see here</a>).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="competitive_block">
          <div>
          <p class="blockquote">We found that competitors use different strategies, but two clear patterns stand out: 1) They ask users what they want to achieve; 2) They highlight their value prop right away.</p>
          <div class="blockquote_line center"></div>
          </div>

          </div>
          <p>With not so much text and a lot of interactive animation, Headspace asks users what their goals are. A powerful sense of personalization and engagement is given.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="competitive-case2">
          <p>Simple Habit focuses on stress, and generates the idea that if users shared what their current status is, then they would help. Again, it´s all about asking users.</p>

          <img src="img/pausa/pausa2_simplehabit.png" class="img_competitive">

          <div>
          <p class="blockquote">This analysis helped us decide to include an “ask the user” feature in our product roadmap. In the short-term, we would start by setting up the correct expectations. How could we better understand what to include? We asked users.</p>

            <p>We ran a survey targeting not only our existing Pausa users but also leads and students from <a href="http://animaedu.com">our other property AnimaEdu</a>. Our main objectives were to understand:</p>
            <p>- What well-being goals people are seeking for.</p>
            <p>- How they meditate (day/night, duration, etc).</p>
            <p>- Their meditation “level” (beginner, advanced, etc.)</p>
            <p>- What features they value or were looking to have.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, some results and insights can´t be disclosed, but a good summary can be found below.</p>

              <li class="space_li">The ability to download our audios and <span style="font-weight:bold">to be able to chat with the instructors</span> were the top valued desired features and something we added to our value prop, and a key message to share when it comes to the onboarding.</li>

              <li class="space_li">Unlike what we had thought, <span style="font-weight:bold">almost 60% of the people meditate for more than 10 minutes per session.</span></li>

              <li class="space_li">The top reason why some people haven´t continued meditating is because they need some level of guidance and <span style="font-weight:bold">consistency they lack by themselves</span>. That helped us define that we would focus on our beginners´ program.</li>

          <h3>USER STORIES</h3>

          <p>Thanks to the competitive analysis and survey conducted, we were able to decide what type of onboarding process we would start with, and what information to consider in our content strategy.</p>
          <p>With this in mind, I listed those tasks that users would like to be able to perform. This was pretty straightforward: A bigger challenge was what content to include.</p>

          <h3>CONTENT STRATEGY</h3>
          <h2>Finding the right "hook".</h2>
          <p>One of our team members took the lead to define what key messages we would be showing to our users, with two main goals in mind: a) To provide them with an overall understanding on how to use Pausa; b) To guide them to what we considered was the best way to start the journey with Pausa: Our 7-day program for beginners.</p>
          <p>But even more important than that, we set up our app to be able to AB test between messages, so as to iterate and find the right hook.</p>

            <p>This allowed me to start playing with different variations at a very low cost. Also, it helped me make sure that I was providing and serving all the high-priority tasks.</p>

          <h2>Going more minimalist.</h2>
          <p>We discussed internally and decided that at this stage we wouldn´t make any major change regarding colors. However, as we were aware of the fact that we would be placing much more text than in other screens, we explored the opportunity to use a white/light background instead of our classic light blue one.</p>
          <p>With this in mind, I sketched different versions, experimented with our primary and secondary colors. The main concept regarding the feeling we wanted to convey was calmness, pureness.</p>

            <p>Once the core design was chosen, it was time to start playing with different variations. It ended up being an iterative process between the content that we were adding and the look and feel. We had key discussions over whether to show a “skip” button, color for CTA, etc.</p>
            <p>Below you can see how the finalized flows and screens looked like, as well as some iterations made throughout the process.</p>

            <p>I essentially played with different types of buttons and colors for the CTA. While leaving the sliders with no Next/Back buttons would give us more space, given our not-so-savvy audience we decided to include visible, simple and intuitive buttons.</p>

            <p>It´s very important to highlight again that we set up the ability to AB test with the text and elements shown in those screens.</p>

            <h2>2x more users listening the second audio.</h2>
            <p>While the percentage of users listening to the first audio of our basic meditation program remained the same, two things are worth noticing:</p>
            <p>- The number of users listening to the second audio increased dramatically (2x). We believe this was caused mainly by other important initiatives taken (e.g. sending push messages reminding them to start the second day of Pausa), which are tied to the overall strategy of onboarding them appropriately.</p>
            <p>- Other users might not start from the first audio of the beginners program. But instead, they would choose more advanced ones.</p>

        <h1>Lessons and further work</h1>
        <p>In these 3 weeks of intense work, we as a team had the opportunity to optimize key areas in Pausa. Not only did we create an onboarding process, but also we set up the machinery to AB test and find the most appealing messaging for our users. There are a few lessons and also a lot more we can and are planning to do:</p>

        <ul>
          <li class="lessons_number">1</li>
          <li class="lessons_tip">We are currently <span style="font-weight:bold">AB testing key messages</span>, using as the main KPI the percentage of users listening to at least one meditation. Key elements to be tested are: a) general benefits to highlight; b) subscription benefits to highlight; c) what screen to take users to after the onboarding</li>
          <li class="lessons_number">2</li>
          <li class="lessons_tip">Ideally, we would include <span style="font-weight:bold">a feature to ask users what their main goals are</span> and show them relevant content based on those goals. As we enlarge our audio offer, this is something we are planning to do.</li>
          <li class="lessons_number">3</li>
          <li class="lessons_tip"><span style="font-weight:bold">If I had more time,</span> I would have added animation to the screens, to make the experience more appealing. This is definitely something that can be worked on in the near future.</li>
